# PPP_emissions
R code to make the estimated use quantities of plant protection product active substances covering the European Union (EU)
We present a dataset of estimated use quantities (also termed “emissions”) 
of plant protection product active substances covering the European Union (EU). 
Emissions of pesticide are estimated for all EU regions in kg applied to various
 categories of land cover, on the basis of data reported by 8 countries (Germany,
 France, Italy, Ireland, Denmark, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands). 
The reported data were extrapolated to the rest of the EU using regression models
 taking into account climate and crop extent variables. 
The resulting estimates allow a representation of pesticide use in a spatially 
explicit way, aggregated by relatively small region (NUTS Level 3 of European 
statistical mapping units) and for various agricultural land cover classes within
 each region. We compare our estimates with aggregated data made available by 
EUROSTAT and with independent, detailed data for the United Kingdom, highlighting
 an error usually within one order of magnitude. This is the error margin that 
we expect when using estimated pesticide use as a surrogate of accurately 
reported data.
